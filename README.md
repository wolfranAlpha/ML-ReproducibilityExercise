## Source

Forked from https://github.com/datamllab/rlcard.

See the forked repository's [README](https://github.com/datamllab/rlcard/blob/master/README.md) for more information.

## About

As part of Bar-Illan University's Advanced AI course, we were tasked with reproducing the results from a paper of our choice.

Because the code from the original paper was so well written, we simply forked it and ran the experiments after understanding the code.

## Reproduction

In order to reproduce the experiments, simply run the python code under [examples](examples/) for the specific experiment you want to reproduce. See the original readme in order to install the dependencies.

All of the graphs from the experiments we ran can be found under `./experiments`.
